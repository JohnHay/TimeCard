.Dt TIMECARD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm timecard
.Nd "synchronise kernel time and provide ntpd(8) with time using an OCP TAP TimeCard"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bc
.Op Fl d Ar driftfile
.Op Fl f Ar /dev/timecardN
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl l Ar logfile
.Op Fl stv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
does 3 main functions:
.Bl -tag -offset "xxxx"
.It Provide a shm(28) driver for ntpd.
.It Synchronise the kernel time to the
.Xr timecard 4
time.
.It Discipline or train the clock on board of the TimeCard through the
.Xr iic 4
Clock interface.
.El
By default all these options are turned on, but can be individually turned off.
.Pp

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-d /dev/timecardN"
.It Fl b
Disable BME monitoring, if it is compiled in.
.It Fl c
Disable TimeCard clock monitoring.
.It Fl d Ar driftfile
The file to periodically write drift values.
It is used to speed up TimeCard clock synchronization.
.It Fl f Ar /dev/timecardN
Specifiy which
.Pa /dev/timecard%d
to use.
If not specified,
.Pa /dev/timecard0
will be used.
.It Fl k
Disable kernel synchronisation.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
The logfile to use for per second logs. If not specified, none will be used.
.It Fl s
Disable ntp shm shared memory interface.
.It Fl t
Disable clock training (disciplining).
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Pp
After initialization,
.Nm
will sit in a loop and once a second:
.Bl -tag -offset "xxxx" -compact
.It read the time and status from Xr timecard 4
.It check the card is still in sync and other sanity checks
.It update the ntp shm(28) interface
.It update the kernel time using Xr ntp_adjtime 2
.It read the Xr timecard 4 clock information
.It write the logfile
.It calculate Xr timecard 4 clock disciplining / training
.It calculate Xr timecard 4 clock aging
.It update Xr timecard 4 clock pull and aging daily once settled
.It update the driftfile (hourly if it changed)
.El
.Pp
The logfile, has the following format:
.Pp
TC sec.nsec OS sec.nsec ClockStatusOffset ClockStatusDrift
ClockStatus TodSlaveStatus TodSlaveAntennaStatus TodSlaveUtcStatus PpsSlaveStatus State Valid
K TC-OS NOffs TSC-diff CPU
XO XOffs Xpwr IICuncorr IICerr
TR TOffs Tsec Offs sec Xadj TC ST Xaging Xpull
.Sh SIGNAL
If
.Nm
receives a SIGHUP signal,
it will close and reopen the logfile.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/null" -compact
.It Pa /dev/timecard%d
.It Pa /dev/iic%d
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of a typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl "timecard -d driftfile.txt -l tc.log"
.Dl "daemon -f -c timecard -d driftfile.txt -l tc.log"
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The command may fail for one of the following reasons:
.Bl -diag
.It "example error message"
An example of an error message.
.It "another example error message."
Self explanatory.
